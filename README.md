# steamDeckWakey
This simple bash script lets the Steam Deck, while docked, be woken up by an Xbox controller OR an 8BitDo Ultimate 2.4g Wireless controller (MUST be using dongle).

Derived from this Reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/10z32c2/how_to_wake_up_steam_deck_with_the_xbox/

To run:
Start Steamdeck in Desktop mode.  Open a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/ninjabat/steamDeckWakey.git
cd steamDeckWakey
chmod +x steamDeckWakey
sudo ./steamDeckWakey
```
